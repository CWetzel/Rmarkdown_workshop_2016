R Markdown
========================================================

In this section we're going to learn the R Markdown basics

- R Markdown renders easiest to a HTML, but we're interested
   in creating a PDF
- The assessment template is designed to only render to a PDF
- Includes flavors of R, LaTeX, and HTML
- It can be quirky at times, i.e. R code will still run within
an HTML comment unless also commented out


How it works
========================================================



When you run render, R Markdown feeds the .Rmd file to knitr, which executes all of the code chunks and creates a new markdown (.md) document which includes the code and itâ€™s output.

The markdown file generated by knitr is then processed by pandoc which is responsible for creating the finished format.
