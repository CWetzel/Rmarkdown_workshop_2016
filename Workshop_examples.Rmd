## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Figure from R code chunk

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Figure from a file

![Here's my caption \label{fig:fig_example}](RMarkdownFLow.png)


##Table

```{r,}
#, results='asis', echo=FALSE, include=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE
Tab = read.csv('Table_example.csv')

Tab_example = xtable(Tab, 
                   caption=c('This is where you write your caption'),
                   label = 'tab:Table_example')

print(Tab_example, include.rownames = FALSE, caption.placement = 'top')

```

We can now reference Table \ref{tab:Table_example}.

##Math mode

You can use LaTeX math mode both inline and for inserting equations. It's handy for using inline math mode for management measure and lat/long.

Inline looks like this:  $SPR_{40\%}$  
*Note the % sign has a \ when used in math mode, but not in R markdown text.

To get degrees and minutes type: $40^\circ 10^\prime$
